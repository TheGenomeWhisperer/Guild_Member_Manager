**VERSION 7.3.0R1.08 - DATE: 29 Aug, 2017**

*UPDATED FOR PATCH 7.3 COMPATIBILITY*

* Note: Oddly, Blizz changed GuildControlSetRank() API function to now a protected function. Not sure why, but it limits ability to pull info on guild rank restrictions and so on... Minor issue, but could potentially cause issues for guilds who have a rank with guild chat restricted. Prob rare case usage.

* Bug Fix1: Error could occur in some cases when parsing through the guild event log to find out WHO did promotions/demotions and so on if server did not provide full info. 


**VERSION 7.2.5R1.075 - DATE: 27 Aug, 2017**

* Bug Fix1: Sync issue that could cause, in certain cases, sync to indefinitely loop and never complete. You'd get all join/promo sync fine, but it would only sync the first 50 alt changes lol OOPS!


**VERSION 7.2.5R1.071 - DATE: 25 Aug, 2017**

* QoL: Options now greyed out and unchecked if player does not have rank access to them.

* Bug Fix1: If a player did not have access to being able to add events to calendar, it would cause an error.

* Bug Fix2: HUGE issue that would cause certain servers with odd names (like Area52), to not sync properly. Works now!

* Bug Fix3: A couple behind-the-scenes fixes that smooth a couple of reported issues out. Complicated so I won't go into much detail here.



**VERSION 7.2.5R1.062 - DATE: 24 Aug, 2017**

***Note** - This is a quick, minor update to fix something real fast. I have other things I am working on, but this is so annoying I decided I wanted to get it out right away*

* Bug Fix1: Quick fix on shift-click names to add as alts. I typo'd a line and it was previously closing window than adding name



**VERSION 7.2.5R1.06 - DATE: 21 Aug, 2017**

*Note: R1.05 was a very small closed beta with a few people, so will be skipped here*

* FEATURE: Notifications! Player can right-click the "status" of player, like AFK, and set notification when no longer

* FEATURE: Player can set to be notified when players login or logoff (more noticeable than Blizz default one)

* FEATURE: Unlimited number of players can be monitored. Of note, they are wiped on each relog, not permanent.

* QOL: Version Check Incorporated. This is not backwards compatible with older version, but from R1.06 and on, player will receive notification if they have outdated addon if others in guild have newer version

* QOL: All future addon users, SYNC is now on by default (though ranks will need to be opened for more than GL)

* Bug Fix1: Addon now takes into consideration guilds with disciplinary ranks that restrict guild chat. This is critical as it can destroy comms and this will resolve a couple of odd bugs.

* Bug Fix2: On rank changes, the addon now takes into consideration rank pre-reqs, like having authenticator and does not attempt to change rank if server will not yet allow.




**VERSION 7.2.5R1.04 - DATE: 15 Aug, 2017**

* QOL: Players full name w/server now viewable on mouseover

* QOL: Name w/server mouseover on alts lits too!

* QOL: ALT CAP REMOVED!!!

* QOL: Player's with more than 12 alts now will have a scrollable alt window!

* QOL: Sync now states when it completes

* Bug Fix1: REMOVE button no longer shows on players of equal or higher rank

* Bug Fix2: Fixed UI bug where it shows promotion/demotion changes, even if player cannot.

* Bug Fix3: Adding event to calendar, description date previously was showing current date, not event date.

* Bug Fix4: Lua error could occur from other addons sharing guild comm channel. Now filters properly.

* Bug Fix5: Shift-clicking roster name now properly places player name where cursor is, not wiping all.


**VERSION 7.2.5R1.03 - DATE: 6 Aug, 2017**

* Bug Fix1: Shift-clicking roster names was wonky on adding alt. It works properly now.

* Bug Fix2: Mousing over names, then shift click if no editbox was focus would cause a Lua error.

* Bug Fix3: Issue where wrong player being selected invisibly in the background, but UI showed proper, thus

* Bug Fix3: behind the scenes it was pulling mismatched data from server on mouseover player at times. No more!

* Bug Fix4: Join Date could get overwritten on new player joining, thus rewriting join date for SYNC as current date

* Bug Fix4: rather than the date they actually joined, or when another player said they joined. This should sync the

* Bug Fix4: the data properly now and not override the correct info.

* Bug Fix5: On a player joining the guild, you could get this error where it would add an officer note as joined on current date, then it would overwrite

* Bug Fix5: it as it pulled the real officer note and spam the log as if it were a change. This annoyingly did it on all new joins

* Bug Fix5: if the player logged in at any date AFTER the player joined originally, if the officer note was tagged. How annoyingly spammy! Fixed

* Bug Fix6: Fixed a Width issue on the Year date on drop-down select that should no longer be an issue for people using non-widescreen resolutions.

* Bug Fix7: Sync on large guilds will now be a bit slower, but it seems it was spamming and disconnecting people even at the previous throttled rate

* Bug Fix7: The new Throttle rate is literally 25% the speed of the previous sync rate. Fortunately it all happens in the background so its not noticeable, just be 

* Bug Fix7: aware Sync will not update within seconds on LARGE guilds, but actually, a couple of minutes to prevent disconnect due to Blizz comm limits.

* Bug Fix7: Please report back if disconnects are gone. ALL in your guild will need to upgrade to current version to prevent disconnects.


**VERSION 7.2.5R1.02 - DATE: 24 July, 2017**

* Bug Fix1: Dynamic and retroactive sync did not work on any realm that had more than one word in the name, like "Burning Legion" or "Area 52"

* Bug Fix1: Never noticed string handling on comms since I tested on single word realm.

* Bug Fix2: Syncing could crash on MEGA guilds! In my 250+ guild, I never noticed any disconnects, but in larger guilds, too much data would be sent 

* Bug Fix2: across the server and would disconnect the player. Now, based on amount of info/size of guild, data packet is controlled to prevent disconnect.

* Bug Fix2: For some larger guilds, sync may no longer take 2-3 seconds for larger guilds. 500 to 1000 member guilds will take anywhere from 15-40 seconds, depending on 

* Bug Fix2: how much alt data needs to sync too. I want to speed it up, but Blizz has internel limits to prevent server spamming. Don't worry, it all happens in background.

* QOL:	Shift-Click player name in the roster and it will add it to anywhere your cursor has focus. It is universally compatible with any frame or addon.


**VERSION 7.2.5R1.00 - DATE: 21 July, 2017**

* Bug Fix1: If a promotion/Demotion was made, there would be a delay on register, which could cause an error when trying to populate the Rank promotion history

* Bug Fix1: Promotions and Demotions now a registered immediately!

* Bug Fix2: Noticed an issue where you could get double spam on reporting changes of public/officer note. This is resolved.

* QOL: Some minor behind-the-scenes tweaking lowered the fingerprint in a couple places. Extremely minimal.


**VERSION 7.2.5Beta_5_R1 - DATE: 20 July, 2017**

* **FEATURE:** SYNCING!!! Seriously, this addon will not sync the player data on rank, promotions, alts/main, and so on, both live and retroactively

*As a quick side note, this was NOT an easy job. Building a resource sensitive dynamic syncing algorithm in Lua, that could retroactively sync changes with guildies, be them online or not at the time was an enormous job. I actually didn't want to do it at first because I saw the scope of the task at hand and didn't want to do it. But, I did it... I think it was worth it!*

* Tons of updates, fixes, QoL features included, many minor, some big. Since this is a massive huge release, let's just consider it a fresh start from here!



**VERSION 7.2.5b500 - DATE: 19 Jun, 2017**

* **FEATURE:** Player zone is now displayed in playerwindow, along with the time duration they have been in the zone. Of note, the player cannot know how long they were in that zone prior to logging, so the time is reset upon logging, but from there on, any zone changes are automatically swept up with timer started for each online player. I am finding it extremely useful for things like not having to ask a player if they just got into that BG, or shouting out when they are in a long arena match, and so on.

* QOL: Fixed some text scaling issues. Ooo, ugly text on some machines. Normalizes all to same static font. Should not be weird now. Let me know if I missed any!

* QOL: Code Cleaned up a little more in a couple of places, which makes it even leaner with less server calls.

* QOL: Wrote some new methods for checking how much time has elapsed from given event, both from epoch time, and from a string timestamp. Much cleaner reporting now.

* QOL: Rearranged the positioning of the Day/Month dropdown as I think it makes more sense to have the month first.

* Bug Fix1: Issue with "mobile" players using armory app, it would screw up alt management. Text name parsed correctly from mobile icon now.

* Bug Fix2: Addon could fail in some circumstances if a player quit the guild and was linked as an alt. Not anymore!



**VERSION 7.2.5b450 - DATE: 19 Jun, 2017**

*Lots of misc. quality of life fixes here. Went through a few requests and got them added, and also worked a little more on the backend on a few things I am working on in a future update.

* Feature: On Mouseover of promotion date, it now includes "how long" a player has been at the promoted rank.

* QOL: Tooltips are now scaled down a little. They were almost obnoxiously large, imo.

* QOL: Note and officer note boxes are better designed. Word wrapping/spacing/etc... Just better

* Bug Fix1: Serious issue with timestamps I had not noticed, as server time was my local time. Apparently I was pulling local, not server, and not realizing it. This could cause issues with people playing in different time-zones than server time... potentially. Resolved

* Bug Fix2: Some issues related to the timstamp problem had to be resolved.

* Bug FixX: There was actually a LOT of behind-the-scenes labor on this one. Much more than you would realized, but there were just so many "little" things not worth mentioning here, but minor QoL stuff I made sure was taken care of.


**VERSION 7.2.5b410 - DATE: 18 Jun, 2017**

* BUG FIX!!! If a player was returning from inactity, I typo'd a bug, but didn't notice it until I was put under the circumstance of a guildie inactive returning. TY @k1ck3r for poinint this out!


**VERSION 7.2.5b400 - DATE: 17 Jun, 2017**

* TONS of work went into this update, even if on the front end the additions seem minimal. In the long run, it will have been worth it for you guys, but also for me as a developer. I won't get into it more. Just know that the x-realm solution was not as easy as I'd hoped because I had to dig into all of my frames and change the approach to how I pulled data. The good thing is it gave me the opportunity to go back and refactor much of my code and it is significantly more efficient now! One downside is your alt/main data needed to be reset. Sorry!*

* **MAJOR FEATURE:** The addon is now compatible with x-realm guilds and should successfully be able to handle multiple people of the same name in a guild, but of different servers. This was a surprisingly HUGE amount of work, even though the solution seemed rather simple. Please let me know if it is working. You MAY need to do a '/roster clearall' and reset your data if you are in a x-realm guild, but I am hoping the addon just sees it as a new person joining the guild. Please let me know how it works as I have not tested it.

*Additionally...*

* Feature: Chat message filtering options now provided for all events.

* Feature: Example, you can now disable leveling notifications to the chat window.

* QOL: Options Panel now opens and closes in a significantly better, and faster, transition

* QOL: Mousing over the roster at times felt a little "sluggish." I sped it up a little.

* QOL: The position you place the Roster Event Log is now saved between sessions.

* QOL: '/roster reset' will reset the window back to its original, centered position.

* QOL: Some text styling has changed, like "PROMOTED" is now "Promoted" and so on...

* Bug Fix1: Log events tracking now should ONLY trigger when updated from the server.

* Bug Fix1: Before, it could do a check before server returned data, thus you would get generic message rather than full details on who did what.

* Bug Fix2: "Clearing" the Rank Promotion history, the "Date Promoted?" button was not returning to proper position.

* Bug Fix3: "Guild Log" button will now seat properly if frame is dragged over it.

* Bug Fix4: Demoting from Main to alt would bug out due to a code typo I introduced last patch and didn't notice. FIXED


**VERSION 7.2.5b300 - DATE: 15 Jun, 2017**

*There was some confusion that was 100% my fault. This IS a BETA release. I mistakenly set it as release. I apologize for that rather serious distinction. As such, it should be noted that THIS IS A MASSIVE RELEASE! HUGE UPDATES!!! Sadly, due to major overhaul of data management and data merging techniques, far more efficient now, it was not backwards compatible. SO SORRY!*

* **MAJOR FEATURE:** Guild data is now stored per faction, and per guild. Are you in a guild that has the same name on both Alliance and Horde side? This should no longer have any issues... Seemless loading as you hop between toons and guilds and factions.


* Bug fix1: Officer Note Editbox was broken last patch. OOPS! Re-fixed

* Bug fix2: Fixed error that *could* happen if player loads addon not in guild, but then joins one. Caused various weird problems. FIXED

* Bug fix3: Namechange detection could error and report incorrectly under various conditions. Tightened to 100% detection.

* Bug fix4: Officer note change spam fixed! Such an annoying bug! Sorry about that one!

* Bug fix5: No merge merge issues!

* QOL: Slash command '/roster' should now open your Log window Properly

* QOL: Grey out options that do not pertain to player if they do not have permissions.

* QOL: Proper error message if player tries to add invalid alt name.

* QOL: Add Event Frame now updates live if events trigger and window is open

* MISC1: Player now can see if a player is on the mobile chat with "Is Mobile" indication

* MISC2: Add Event Calendar now restricts the player to adding 1 event to calendar per 5 seconds, due to internal Blizz server limit.

* MISC3: Several more things being tracked in the background... to be implemented in future patch 

* MISC4: And several other minor things not worth mentioning...


**VERSION 1.02 - DATE: 13 Jun, 2017**

* Feature1: You can now right click player name in main window for additional options

* Feature2: You can now reset an individual's saved data, if needed.

* Feature3: Better main/alt management - ability to set player as main, even without alts

* Feature3: This allows any subsequent alts added to auto-be tagged as "alt" instad of main. Minor QoL.

* Bug fix1: TAINT issues have been resolved (by building my own Dropdowns) - HUGE JOB

* Buf fix1: You no longer should be unable to enter a BG without disabling addon, for example!

* Bug fix2: Scaling issue (yes, not ALL scaling issues are resolved yet)

**VERSION: 1.01 - DATE: 11 Jun, 2017**

* Bug fix: On player namechange detection, it now changes the name in the alts lists as well!


**VERSION: 1.00 - DATE: 11 Jun, 2017**

* Initial Release
