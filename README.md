GUILD ROSTER MANAGER
==================
**FOREWORD**

**NOTE:** SYNC is not enabled by default with all guildies, just the top 3 ranks. You may want to adjust this on first use. On the initial log frame ( /roster ), under options, you may want to first, set the minimum rank to sync data with. Don't miss out on such a valuable feature by not choosing the ranks you wish to sync with. I personally sync with all guildies except newest rank. Some larger guilds, to avoid trolls, choose to just sync with their officers. You choose who you want to.

I wrote this addon mostly for myself. As someone who has been a guild leader for many years, there are just some features I have wanted for quite a while, and I don't feel like the current options truly fit my needs and desires. I want to do more than just bring something to the table that currently doesn't exist, but instead, I wanted to bring it to the table in a clean, easy-to-use UI, that was logical, that was customizable, and something that could be expanded upon on request. I also built it 100% from the ground up. Zero dependencies. Zero libraries added. Zero UI taint. I built everything and every frame from scratch.
